This is a utility to 
- read recordings from a Ruideng TC66 USB tester 
- poll the TC66 at set intervals to get all available data and save it in CSV format to be processed in Excel or other spreadsheet programs

The utility is written to allow the use as a class by other python programs 

Credit: 
I used the info here: https://sigrok.org/wiki/RDTech_TC66C for coding the protocol and decrypting the data

Updated: the files TC66_V1.x.x.apk are TC66C firmware updates. They tend to disappear from the Ruideng site, so I thought to preserve some incase someone needs to roll-back
